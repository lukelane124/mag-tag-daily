================================ Mag Tag Project ===============================
~~~~~~ Goals ~~~~~~
1. Learn about ESP32-S2
2. Learn about e-ink displays as found on the mag-tag
3. Create a simple view of today that I can glance at on my fridge in the morning.
4. Learn about CircuitPython.

+++++++++++++ ESP32-S2 +++++++++++++
The ESP32 platform is extremely promising. I'd like to learn as much as I can
about it going forward. The BLE aspect bundled with WiFi makes the ESP32 series
a comparatively low power option for bringing networking to the embedded 
project.
I'd like to learn enought about it to begin incorporating ESP32 in most/all of my personal projects.

++++++++++++++ E-INK +++++++++++++++
E-ink displayes have many use cases where power is a concern. If nothing needs
to be updated then nothing has to be updated. This power savings can be leveraged with minimal effort if done strategically.

++++++++++ Circuit Python ++++++++++
I've never used Circuit Python and find it to be an oversimplification of most
embedded system coding efforts. However, I can't deny that it has made many
more DIY projects practical to achieve in a Much shorter window of time.
I'd like to become more familiar with CircuitPython in general as it has a great
potential to help me incorporate python deeper in my workflow.

================================= System Status ================================Very much a work in progress. Currently only prints a very basic summary of the
current weather. The code seems to only work intermittently. After several sleep
operations the system comes crashing down on itself. I haven't the time to
investigate currently. That's my plan for later tonight.
